# Landing Page Practice

Just a simple project to get familiar with the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. I also used [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) templating engine to avoid writing repetitive HTML for multiple instances of the same component on the page. I also used [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as a dev server.
